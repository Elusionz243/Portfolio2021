            <p>I've been passionate about the web since I was young.
              Growing up I would scour the web to learn about solving Rubikâ€™s cubes, puzzles in video games,
              and much more.
              I've been living on the web for most of my life, and as time went by, the web inspired me to start programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found my passion for programming at the age of twelve, when I started learning Java.
              I studied Java in order to program my own games and mod a game called <a
                href='https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/' style={{ textDecoration: 'none', color: 'lime' }}>Minecraft</a>.
              I worked with many different teams of developers,
              creating mods and configuration for a variety of Minecraft servers.
              I've always enjoyed working on a team, and am excited for all
              the teams I'm going to meet in the future.
            </p>
            <p>Coding hasn't always been my passion though. In fact, I have learned many
              different skills that have nothing
              to do with coding. Such as skateboarding, origami, speed cubing, guitar,
              and piano.
              I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the <a href='https://www.scouting.org/' style={{ textDecoration: 'none', color: 'gold' }}>Boy
                Scounts of America</a> in 2016.
              I've always enjoyed learning new things, and will never stop.</p>
